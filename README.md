# Tree-Crown-Detection-and-Segmentation

## About

This method is for identifying individual tree crowns from airborne LiDAR data. The method is used to delineate tree crowns using a region-growing algorithm after initially identifying tree tops in the rasterised middle and top layer of the point cloud.The accuracy is measured through the estimated values and the ground truth.
